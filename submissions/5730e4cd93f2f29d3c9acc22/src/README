Algorithm:
1) check that the parameter passed (hereinafter the word) is a string of
  non-zero length;
2) check that the word does not contain extra characters;
3) check that the word is not included in the list of words containing bigrams
  that are not may be included in English words (there are a lot of such
  pseudo-English words in the provided list), and are not included in the list
  of words-exclusion for which I have not written any rules, but simply
  hardcoded;
4) check that the word includes prefixes d'/ mc / mac, if so, then remove
  prefixes and return the remaining part;
5) check that the word contains an apostrophe, and if the word is from the list
  of words-exclusion with an apostrophe, then result is positive, or if the word
  contains the 's at the end, then remove it and return the remaining part;
6) check the length of the word, if it is greater than 25, then check whether
  the word in the list of words with a length greater than 25 (the maximum word
  length of provided list - 60, in this case I chose 25, because the size of the
  script does not fit in the restriction with shorter length);
7) the final test - whether the word includes impossible bigrams, if so, the
  result is negative, otherwise positive.
