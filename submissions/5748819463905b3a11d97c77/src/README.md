TODO: 

// here must be a long list

General:

> complete the list of morphological rules

> (!) detect a word type and trim all morphemes for reaching of a stem
> (!) extract the word stem(s)! < this should be essential for the correct word matching
> (!) differentiation of morphemes - integrate and continuosly improve (building noun->adj, verb->noun, adj->adv etc.) 

> check word bindings

> add prefixes ruleset (check how to deal with noun->noun)

> more consonant clusters integrity!
> more differentiation (verb forms)

> more regex! more rulesets (currently only positive / negative lookahead implemented)
> once the web of word trimming rules is wired, the whole could lead to perfect result achievements

Stay in touch,
