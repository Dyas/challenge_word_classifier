Sorry for my code - I'm a junior.

1. lower everything in words.txt
2. run distinct
3. select only the words that have length between 5 and 14 (included)
4. eliminate all the words that have "'" and are not finish with "'s" (later put them in the js file)
5. eliminate all the words that finish with "'s" for which there isn't a word in the list that is the same without the last 2 characters (put them in the js file)
6. replace "'s" with 2
7. eliminate all the word1s where word1 = another_word+"2"
8. make a list with all the words that finish with 2 (in order) and append the rest of list#1
9. reverse all words. make sure that "2" stays at the end of the word
10. replace "2" with "E"
11. put the words that contain "B" at the end of the list (see the dictionary)
12. get all the possible combination of 2 letters that aren't in words.txt
13. use https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/ for solution.js
