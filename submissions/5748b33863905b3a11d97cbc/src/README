My approach:

1) First do (easy) stemming as much as possible, such as merging apostrophes with their original
words, and also to merge the various tenses of a verb to one form.

2) Generate a hashtable of the given words.

3) Given a word, first stem the word, and then check against the hashtable whether it exists in
the dictionary or not.

This approach is pretty effective in identifying "true" words, but failed to identify many
"false" words possibly due to collision in the hashtable. I could have used ngrams to address this
as they might be helpful in identifying the patterns of non-English words.

I used Python to implement several preliminary scripts. The config.py file is omitted.
